0.2.0	Initial release
		Simple simulation, no costs or termination

0.3.0	Bugs fixed:
		Fixed Cancel button to cancen the sim
		Fixed "Simulation Active" message not being displayed during sim
		Disabled Quicksave and Quickload functions

		New Features:

			flatPerMinCost 
			perTonSetupCost 
			perTonPerMinCost 
			AtmoPerMinMultipler

		the basic values (if present).

		API added for modders

0.3.1	Bug fix:
		Disable view of costs when not in career mode
		Fix sandbox & science mode (wasn't starting at all)

0.3.2	Bug fix:
		When in Pause menu, game is not paused even though menu is up
		Switching to another craft causes Pause menu to fail
		In sandbox, go to another planet, then return and start career game, that last planet is still available
		Make simcosts text larger
		Decimal points not being accepted at end of number for lat/long

0.4.0
		Reduced starting costs by 90% based on feedback
		Added % of initial ship cost to cost structure
		Added description to cfg file
		Added new cfg file for custom settings
		Added abililty to relocate running costs during sim, or not display altogether
		Added dialog to pause when ship lands
0.5.2
		Updated for 1.1
		Fixed bug where funds weren't being deducted at end of simulation from current funcs
0.5.3
		Added Changed estimated calcs of cost from Floor to Round, to 1 decimal place
0.5.4
		Added code to ensure that no latitude or longitude of 0.0 will be passed to Unity, this to work
		around a Unity bug.
0.5.5
		Added code to hide costs if UI is hidden
		Fixed issue when in career mode, if sim terminated in crash, unable to restart sim
		Fixed issu e where Flight results dialog would show up multiple times
0.5.6
		Added some code to check for a null value from the ProgressTracking when launching a sim
0.5.7
		Fixed issue where a ship could be recovered when landed, or return to space center when landed, and then 
		recover ship from space center.  Recovery tab disabled
0.5.8
		Fixed constant exceptions when in flight from KSP.UI.Screens.AltimeterSliderButtons.LateUpdate
0.5.9
		Fixed slowdown during simulation mode 
0.5.10
		Fixed bug where a ship too big or heavy for the launchpad/runway would be allowed to launch, but the game
		would then stop it, leaving the sim enabled until a real launch was done
		Fixed inability to hide sim costs during sim
		Fixed NullReferenceException when first opening a career game from the main menu
0.5.11
		Fixed issue where you couldn't start a sim in orbit or landed
0.5.12
		Fixed checks for size, mass & part count for orbital & landed sims to properly check against facility being used
0.5.13
		Fixed bug where ships length & width were being added together when checking for a ship too wide
		Added display of reasons for inability to start sim, along with the limit being exceeded
0.5.14
		Fixed exploding ships after teleport
0.5.15
		Fixed exploding ships after teleport to landed state
		Fixed issue where if flight can't be entered due to some reason, simulation mode will be exited.
			This can happen in the following two (known) scenarios:
				1.  Try to launch, no kerbals available, cancel launch
				2.  In career mode, if you try to simulate a vessel for which you haven't researched the parts, 
					the simulation does not start but the game remains in simulation mode. Obviously can happen only 
					if you import a ship design from another save. 
0.5.16
		The previous fix wasn't good, and it was still staying in sim mode, now fixed

0.5.17
		Added check for enough funds in Editor
		Now uses the MaxAllowableSimCost to set the initial default value
		Renamed MaxAllowableSimCost to DefaultMaxAllowableSimCost
		Moved cfg files into PluginData folder

0.5.17.1
		Recompile for 1.1.3

0.5.18
		Added option to show all bodies in career mode

0.5.18.1
		Fixed build script to create the PluginData directory
