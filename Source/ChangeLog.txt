		Fixed Cancel button to cancen the sim
		Fixed "Simulation Active" message not being displayed during sim
		Disabled Quicksave and Quickload functions

		New Features:

			flatSetupCost 
			flatPerMinCost 
			perTonSetupCost 
			perTonPerMinCost 
			AtmoPerMinMultipler

0.3.1	Bug fix:
		Disable view of costs when not in career mode

		Switching to another craft causes Pause menu to fail
		In sandbox, go to another planet, then return and start career game, that last planet is still available

		Decimal points not being accepted at end of number for lat/long

0.4.0
		Reduced starting costs by 90% based on feedback
		Added % of initial ship cost to cost structure
		Added description to cfg file

		Added dialog to pause when ship lands
0.5.2
		Updated for 1.1
		Fixed bug where funds weren't being deducted at end of simulation from current funcs
0.5.3
		Added Changed estimated calcs of cost from Floor to Round, to 1 decimal place
0.5.4
		Added code to ensure that no latitude or longitude of 0.0 will be passed to Unity, this to work
		around a Unity bug.
0.5.5
		Added code to hide costs if UI is hidden
		Fixed issue when in career mode, if sim terminated in crash, unable to restart sim
