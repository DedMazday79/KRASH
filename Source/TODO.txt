
Simulation costs have several parts:

Initial setup
Cost per minute
Restarting simulation does not have any additional cost, but cost per minute will continue to accrue
Costs only apply to career mode, not science or sandbox
The costs will be configurable via an interface.  I'll have an initial setup of costs, but they will all be configurable via the interface.
